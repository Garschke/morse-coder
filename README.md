Morse code is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.  Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy.

International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a to z, one accented Latin letter (Ã©), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message, once established it is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit (although some telegraphers deliberately exaggerate the length of a dah for clearer signalling). Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.


Text to Morse Code Converter
Description
This Python project converts plain text into Morse code. It's a simple and educational tool that demonstrates string manipulation and basic encoding concepts. Whether you're learning about Morse code or just having fun with text conversion, this tool makes it easy!

Features
Converts English text into Morse code.
Supports letters A-Z (case insensitive), numbers 0-9, and basic punctuation.
Handles spaces between words appropriately in the output.
Demo
Include a screenshot or GIF showing your program in action.
